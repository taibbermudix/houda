            I love the gentle line of your nose, each detail so effortlessly beautiful, like it was shaped by a quiet artist with the softest touch. And your hair, cascading like poetry, framing your face in a way that leaves me breathless—it’s as though each strand dances to its own rhythm, echoing your grace Then there’s your lips tempting and kissable each curve inviting me closer, leaving me with a longing I can’t seem to satisfy. I’m drawn to your presence, to the warmth and elegance of your body, every line and angle You are a masterpiece and in every glance every touch you leave me spellboundIt’s as if you were crafted to be adored  and I am helplessl  irrevocably yours and also my dearest Houda, I am so endlessly proud of you. Proud of every battle you’ve fought, every burden you’ve carried alone, every struggle you’ve conquered even when the weight seemed too heavy to bear. I know these past years have tested you in ways no one else could fully understand, and though you faced it all on your own, you never gave in. You kept moving forward, step by step, with a strength that leaves me in awe.
            I want you to know that no matter how far life pulls us, even if we drift in silence, I will always be here. I promise, through every season, every quiet space, every moment of doubt, I am yours, a constant presence. You are never alone, not anymore. If you ever find yourself lost or feel there’s no one left, just remember: I am here, waiting, with unwavering love and open arms. And I always will be, proud of you, with every beat of my heart, for all the days to come kanbghik habibi m sorry if i forgot any detail if i didnt mention smthng important i wouild love u to remind me of it</p>
